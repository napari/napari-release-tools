### Transition to npe2 plugin engine 🔌

In 0.6.0 we began the process of deprecating npe1 (napari-plugin-engine).
In all 0.6.x releases, npe1 plugins were automatically converted to npe2 by default,
and users could turn off the `use_npe2_adaptor` setting to continue using npe1 plugins
without auto-conversion.

In 0.7.0 this setting is being removed ([PR #8448](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8448)),
and plugins will *only* continue to function if
they can be auto-converted to npe2. Most plugins will be unaffected, but those that rely
on import-time behaviour may not work as expected. If a plugin is relying on import-time
behaviour, it may be able to replicate this using the new startup scripts functionality added
in 0.6.5 ([#8188](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8188)).

If you encounter conversion issues in a plugin you rely on, please contact the
plugin authors to encourage them to migrate their plugin to the npe2 system.

This change has been a long time coming, and it's allowed us to remove thousands
of lines of tangled and confusing legacy code. Now that we have, it's unleashed
the potential for massive improvements to file opening and saving in `napari`,
and exciting new features for our plugin infrastructure. Stay tuned!

For more details on this change and how it affects plugins, see the [detailed
guide](adapted-plugin-guide). If you are a plugin author and your plugin is not
yet npe2-compatible, please see our [npe2 migration
guide](npe2-migration-guide), and, if you encounter any issues, get in touch in
our [Plugins Zulip chat
channel](https://napari.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/309872-plugins) or by
coming to one of our [community meetings](meeting-schedule).

### More pixels to play with - texture tiling

Ever loaded a large 2D image in napari just to zoom in and find it's blurrier
than a JPEG from the year 2000? That's no longer the case!

Courtesy of our community contributor, Guillaume Witz (@guiwitz), and his PR for
texture tiling ([PR #8395](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8395)) 2D
images that exceed OpenGL's maximum texture size will be split into multiple
tiles, each small enough to fit on the GPU, and rendered as separate vispy `Image` node.

### What's my metadata? Where's my metadata? `napari-metadata` to the rescue

With a lot of work from our community contributor, Carlos Mario Rodriguez Reza (@carlosmariorr), and
our venerable community manager Tim Monko (@TimMonko), `napari` now has a metadata viewing and editing plugin
included in our `napari[all]` installation and our bundle ([PR #8576](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8576)).

![Screenshot of napari displaying an image of neurons, with the napari-metadata Layer Metadata widget across the bottom of the viewer.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/napari/napari-metadata/main/resources/horizontal-widget.png)

Open the `Layer metadata` widget from the `Plugins` menu and you can view File information, and view and edit Axes metadata such as
axis labels, translation and scale! You can also use the widget to copy specified metadata across to other layers.

Check out the [README](https://github.com/napari/napari-metadata) for some usage documentation, and feel
free to open an issue to request new features -- we're actively improving this plugin so, more to come!

### (Layer) Features galore

Prior to 0.7.0, our Features table widget only supported showing individual selected layer features.

With [#8189](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8189), courtesy of our community 
contributor Marcelo Zoccoler (@zoccoler), the widget will display
features of all selected layers! The layer's name is displayed in an additional column, so you 
always know what you're looking at, and you can choose to display only the shared feature columns
across all layers. Pretty slick!

### Imitation is the highest form of flattery - smarter new layer buttons

Prior to 0.7.0, creating a new layer Points, Shapes or Labels layer would give you a layer
with extent and dimensionality equal to the union of all currently open layers, and with
none of the other spatial information (scale, units, etc.) inherited.

Now, with [#8357](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8357) you can create a new Shapes
or Points layer (Labels coming soon!) that inherits from a selected layer
(or a combination of selected layers)! Your new layer will copy all spatial information
from its ancestor, ready for annotating!

TODO: add image of the different button visual, once merged, and note

If you wish to recover the original behavior, deselect all existing layers before creating your new layer.

PS - You can now also create these new layers from the `File -> New Layer` menu!

### Negative axis labels? A real positive

If you've ever loaded data of mixed dimensionality in napari, like a TYX volume
alongside a YX segmentation, you may have noticed the default axis labels didn't
quite line up:

```
axes  | 0 | 1 | 2
volume| 0 | 1 | 2
segmt |   | 0 | 1
```

That's because napari used 0-based indexing for its viewer axis labels, which breaks
down when layers have different numbers of dimensions. With
[#8565](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8565),
viewer axis labels now use negative indexing by default, just like Python's own indexing
semantics. The last axis is always `-1`, the second-to-last is always `-2`, and so on:

```
axes  | 0  | 1  | 2
volume| -3 | -2 | -1
segmt |    | -2 | -1
```

This means axis labels stay consistent as you add or remove layers of different
dimensionality -- axis `-1` is always your last axis. This also fixes
a long-standing bug where axis labels could end up duplicated when mixing layers of
different dimensionality ([#6569](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/6569)).

You'll notice this change in the dims slider labels, the axis overlay, and the dims
popup widget. If you already label your axes with your own names (e.g. `z`, `y`, `x`),
nothing's changed. For everyone else, we have consistency at last!

### Lightning labels

Labels painting on large images used to be sluggish. Polygon fills on a 10000x10000
label array took over 22 seconds, and large brush sizes would lock up the viewer entirely.

With [#8592](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8592), polygon rasterization now uses
PIL instead of scikit-image's `polygon2mask`, giving us an up to 6x speedup,
and `data_setitem` now uses numpy's `min`/`max`, giving us an up to 4x speedup!

Small changes, big wins!

### Grid mode -- bigger, better, faster 📈

If you've been playing with our new grid mode since 0.6.5, you 
may have stumbled into performance issues when progressively adding
new layers to the viewer. Stumble no longer! Our grid mode is now wicked fast and buttery smooth 🧈.

We've also fixed some issues with mouse interactions and deleting
layers, so you can tile to your heart's content. Try it out:

```py
import napari

viewer = napari.Viewer()

# enable grid with stride 2 to get layers split two-by-two
viewer.grid.enabled = True
viewer.grid.stride = 2

# set the scale bar to gridded mode so it appears in each grid box
viewer.scale_bar.visible = True
viewer.scale_bar.gridded = True

layers = viewer.open_sample('napari', 'lily')

# enable color bars
for layer in layers:
    layer.colorbar.visible = True
```

### What's in an angle? The truth! Fixed camera angles 🎥

If you've ever set up the camera to take that perfect publication-worthy photo of 
your data (and taken the time to query the camera angles), you may have noticed they seemed... off.
That's because they were! Very... off. This was due to a long-standing bug in how we calculated our
camera angles, fueled in part by some arcane vispy axis-swapping tomfoolery, and in part by napari's
starting position of `viewer.camera.angles = (0, 0, 90)`.

Good news! With [#8281](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8281), angles make sense again. The default camera angles are `(0, 0, 0)`, and they
move intuitively -- so `viewer.camera.angles = (0, 0, 10)` actually represents a 10 degree
rotation around the 0th dimension. What a time to be alive!

Old versions of napari:

![Image showing an old version of a napari viewer with a layer opened and its camera angle (10, 0, 0) displayed in the console.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae2040c-36f7-4c4c-8ef8-140202d7ccda)

New and sane:

![Image showing the 0.7.0 napari viewer with a layer opened and its camera angle (10, 0, 0) displayed in the console. The layer is rotated 10 degrees in its first dimension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b972b46-5c3c-439a-8b0a-fe8a293224e5)

All rotations are now right-handed (counterclockwise when the axis points towards the viewer),
with automatic sign-flipping for flipped camera views. We've also removed the unwieldy to type
(and confusing to reason about) `quaternion2euler_degrees` in favour of scipy's `Rotation` class.

Now for the bad news... After many (and we do [mean](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8537)
[**many**](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8557)) attempts, we realized we couldn't
provide legacy conversion functions to get you to and from the original camera angles. Therefore,
this is a **breaking change**.

If you had scripts or notebooks setting up angles for screenshots, or if you've got workshop
materials or tutorials with preset angles, they'll need to be updated. Any existing code
using `viewer.camera.angles = (z, y, x)` will now produce a different view than before.
