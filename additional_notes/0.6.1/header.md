We’re happy to announce the release of napari 0.6.1! This release is a follow-up to 0.6.0, with a few bug fixes and new features.

napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It’s designed for exploring, annotating, and analyzing multi-dimensional images. It’s built on Qt (for the GUI), VisPy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, and friends).
